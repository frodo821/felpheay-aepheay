Here is the root of personal pronouns in Felpheay Aepheay. Please ignore the suffixed - with those roots of pronouns.

| First person | Second person | Third person |
| :----------: | :-----------: | :----------: |
|     ti-      |     nei-      |     neu-     |

Use those roots with declension suffixes to express personal pronouns. For example:

- tir: I (masculine)
- tia: I (feminine)
- timn: We (neuter, dual)

"Frodo tira ner tep." means "My name is Frodo." The word "ner" (masculine noun, nominative) means "name" in English.

Here are impersonal pronouns. Impersonal pronouns include het- (this, close to the first person side) teb- (it, neither close, or distance unknown) je- (that, close to the second person side, or distance unknown) do. Also, cet- exists as an interrogative pronoun (please ignore suffixed - too).

And here are some examples about nominatives by gender.

- hetr: het, masculine, nominative
- heta: het, first female, nominative
- hetie: het, second female, nominative (used to describe the place "here")
- tebr: teb, masculine, nominative
- teba: teb, first female, nominative
- tebie: teb, second female, nominative (used to describe a place "over there")
- jer: je, masculine, nominative
- jea: je, first female, nominative
- jeie: je, second feminine, nominative (used to describe the place "there")
- cetr: cet, masculine, nominative
- ceta: cet, first female, nominative
- cetie: cet, second female, nominative (used to express a question about a place, `where`)

Please note the root of the interrogative pronoun, "cet," is also used to mark the sentence as a yes/no question. For this use, only the root, in other words without declension suffixes, is appeared. In other words, when exactly "cet," but not "cetr," "cetm" nor so on, is appeared, the sentence is a yes/no question. Not "cet" but "cetr," "cetm" or so on is appeared, it is not a yes/no question.

For example, "Cet tuat neir tuameph?" means "Did you eat something?" "tuat" is the past tense of the secondary conjugating verb "tual" (eat in English), and "tuameph" (neuter noun, dative) means dietary in English. Addditional example, "Cetep neir tuat?" means "What did you eat?" "Cetep" is "cet" with neuter dative inflection suffix, so it is not a yes/no question.

Heugeal (describe or write, secondary conjugating verb) is derived verb from heur (a book), for example how verbs are derived from nouns. Most of those verbs are secondary conjugating verbs.
